Copy the shell scripts and `paperless.conf` file into your `paperless-ngx/` installation directory.  Edit `paperless.conf` and set the PAPERLESS_DB* options appropriately.  Change every instance of the string 'your-hostname-here' to the hostname of the machine you installed paperless-ngx on.  Set PAPERLESS_NLTK_DIR to the full path to your [NLTK data](https://www.nltk.org/data.html) directory (by default, `/home/your-username-here/nltk_data`).
